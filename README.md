We provide the processed datasets for a subset of our 8 tasks. These datasets include ones from the [Newsroom](https://lil.nlp.cornell.edu/newsroom/index.html), [SciERC](http://nlp.cs.washington.edu/sciIE/), and the [Media Frames Corpus](https://github.com/dallascard/media_frames_corpus) that we processed for this project. For the political affiliations dataset, we omit text data and only provide the labels and tweet ids. We also omit the Yelp and twitter NER data. Please see the [yelp](https://www.yelp.com/dataset) or [Shruti's Github](https://github.com/shrutirij/temporal-twitter-corpus).
